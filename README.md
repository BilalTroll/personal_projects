My personal repository of projects. This took me roughly three months to create and involves two seperate running programs, each one for a different use case.

**ProfitalTradesBot**


  Imports to use:
    pycoingecko,
    requests,
    discord,
    selenium,
    os,
    time.

  How do I use this?
    Open the file with your favorite text/code editor.
    Enter your preferred profitable % percent, optimally around ~7%. This means look for trade where you can make ~7% in a trade.
    Enter your preffered liquidity, optimally around 15000. This means look for trades where there is more then enough liquidity to not impact the price to much.
    Connect a discord bot with the token, adding that to the program.
    Run the program.
    Profit.
