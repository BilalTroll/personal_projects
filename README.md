# ARBRITAGE BOT
##### created by Bilal Zakaria


### What is This?
This is an automated software that scoures both coingecko and energiswap for arbritage opportunities.

 > the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.

I've *20x'ed* my portfolio using this bot, and is my pride and joy. Enjoy using it as much as I have.


### How do I use this?
Due to some privacy concerns, some lines of code have been removed, but a large majority exists and with a bit of work, you can make it your own as well. After all, this is being provided for *free :-)*.

Open the **beta.py** file using python **3**, and set up your parameters in the **parameters.py** file.

If your coin is on energiswap, this bot supports it.
